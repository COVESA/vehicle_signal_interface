#
#    Set the "TOP" environment variable to be the location of the top level
#    source directory in the current branch.  This is done by executing a bit
#    of shell code that traverses up the directory tree until it finds a
#    directory containing the marker file.  That directory is the root of the
#    current code tree and "TOP" will be set to that directory.  The "TOP"
#    directory will be used to build the distribution directories like "lib"
#    and "include".
#
#    Note that we only do this if the user has not set the value explicitly.
#    This variable should always be set by the time we get to this point in
#    the makefile processing.
