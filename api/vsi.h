    @brief Used to pass data to and return data from the API.

    The contents of this structure must be initialized with the information
    required by the function being called as input (often the domain and
    signal ID or the signal name) and the results of the function execution
    will be returned in the structure upon exit.

    Note that when the data and dataLength fields are required, the caller is
    responsible for allocating a memory area large enough to contain the data
    being asked for.  The dataLength parameter then specifies the size of that
    allocated memory area.  Many of the functions that return data in these
    fields will replace the dataLength value with the actual number of bytes
    written into the data buffer before returning to the caller.

    Return data will always be written with the minimum of either the size of
    the data being returned or the size of the supplied buffer, whichever one
    is smallest.  No data in the buffers past the actual returned data will be
    changed, that is, the buffer will not be padded with any data to fill it
    out to it's specified size.

    This structure contains a mutex so that the threads can lock this
    structure while reading or writing their results into it without being
    interrupted by another thread trying to do the same thing... First one in
    the pool wins!

    The domainId is an identifier for which domain this record should be
    stored in.  This is currently defined as a small positive integer value.

    The signalId is a numeric value which will identify the specific signal
    desired by the caller within the domain specified.

    The signal name is an ASCII string that uniquely identifies the signal in
    question.

    The data pointer is the address of the buffer which constains the record
    data.  Note that the data is not assumed to be ASCII in nature so it is
    the caller's responsibility to ensure that it is null terminated if need
    be.

    The dataLength parameter is the size of the user's data buffer being
    supplied.  This is the maximum number of bytes of data that will be copied
    into the supplied buffer by the API code.  This value should be set to the
    maximum size of the data buffer being supplied.  If the data buffer
    supplied is not large enough to contain the entire data record, the data
    will be truncated to fix into the buffer.

    Generally speaking, the "result" pointer defined in the functions that
    follow is actually a pointer to an array of "vsi_result" structures.  If
    the operation only operates on a single signal then this is an array of
    length 1 or simply a single structure.  If the function being used can
    return data for multiple signals then this pointer is actually a pointer
    to an array of "vsi_result" structures where the number of structures must
    be at least as large as the maximum number of signals that could be
    returned by the call.

    The status parameter will contain the return status of the function that
    was called.  For operations on more than one result structure, the status
    field is set individually for each result structure to reflect any errors
    that may have been encountered during the propressing of that structure.

    The caller is responsible for allocating and deallocating all of these
    structures and buffers.

    @brief Fire a vehicle signal by its ID.

    These functions will allow an application to generate a new signal into
    the VSI database.  The signal can be specified with either it's name or
    its domain and ID.  If the name form is used, the specified name must be
    defined in the VSS specification for this signal set, otherwise, an error
    will be generated.

    These calls will copy the supplied information into the VSI database and
    if another thread or process is waiting on that signal, processing will
    resume for that thread or process.  This call will return to the caller
    immediately under all circumstances with the return value indicating the
    status of the operation.

    The handle parameter is the handle to the current VSI database context
    that was returned by the vsi_initialize call.

    The following fields must be set in the result data structure:

    The domainId is an identifier for which domain this record should be
    stored in.  This is currently defined as a small positive integer value.

    The signalId is a numeric value which will identify the specific signal
    desired by the caller within the domain specified.

    The data length parameter is the size of the user's data buffer being
    supplied.  This is the maximum number of bytes of data that will be copied
    into the supplied buffer by this code.  This value should be set to the
    maximum size of the data buffer being supplied.  If the data buffer
    supplied is not large enough to contain the entire data record, the data
    will be truncated to fix into the buffer.

    The data pointer is the address of the buffer in which the record data
    will be copied.  Note that the data is copied as binary data and will not
    automatically have a null appended to it if it is actually ASCII data.  It
    is the caller's resonsibility to ensure that if the data being retrieved
    is ASCII data, that those strings are properly null terminated.

    TODO: What happens if the specified signal does not exist yet?

    This function returns a 0 upon success and an errno code otherwise.

    @param[in] - handle - Required handle for the API.

    @brief Fetch the oldest entry in the core database for a signal.

    This function will find the oldest entry in the core database for the
    specified signal domain and ID and return the data associated with that
    signal to the caller.  The signal data returned will be removed from the
    core database and will no longer be available to anyone.

    The calling application is responsible for providing a vsi_result structure
    as input and for providing both a pointer to a valid data buffer and the
    length of the buffer inside that structure as information in the
    structure. The API will write data to the buffer and overwrite the length
    field with the number of bytes written. If the API detects an error
    specific to the signal, it will log an error in the status field of the
    structure.

    If two or more signals have been generated since the last read, the oldest
    signal will be read first. Once the oldest signal has been read, the
    message will be removed from the core database, thereby "consumming" the
    data.  Calling applications may continue to consume data by issuing
    additional calls to vsi_get_oldest_signal until they reach the end of the
    buffer, where an error will be returned to indicate that there is no more
    data.

    The following fields must be supplied in the result data structure:

    The domainId is an identifier for which domain this record should be
    stored in.  This is currently defined as a small positive integer value.

    The signalId is a numeric value which will identify the specific signal
    desired by the caller within the domain specified.

    The name is an ASCII character string that has been defined in the VSS and
    associated with a domain and a numeric signal ID value.

    The calling application is responsible for providing a vsi_result structure
    as input and for providing both a pointer to a valid data buffer and the
    length of the buffer as information in the structure. The API will write
