	@brief Perform a "post" operation on a semaphore.

	This function will perform a "post" operation on a semaphore object
	(similar to a "signal" on a mutex).  This operation will increment the
	semaphore's count value and if there are any processes waiting on this
	semahore, one (or possibly more) of them will be released and allowed to
	run.  Under normal conditions, only one waiting process will be released
	when this signal occurs but there is a very small window in which more
	than one could be released.  This is not a problem - See the man page for
	pthread_cond_signal.

	That this code assumes that the semaphore object to be operated on already
	exists and has been mapped into this process's shared memory segment.  The
	semaphore must already have been initialized as well.

	@param[in] semaphore - The address of the semaphore object to operate on.
